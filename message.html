    <p>
        My love, you are truly the most beautiful girl I know. Not just because of your smile that lights up my world, but because of your heart, your kindness, and the way you carry yourself with so much grace. Being with you is one of the greatest blessings of my life.
    </p>

    <p>
        I want you to know that I will forever respect you, cherish you, and honor the incredible woman you are. You deserve a love that is patient, gentle, loyal, and pure and that is the kind of love I promise to give you every single day.
    </p>

    <p>
        My love for you is deep. It’s not something temporary or shallow. We’ve faced challenges, and there was a time when we almost lost each other because I was too hurt to stay. But you fought for us. You didn’t give up on us when things were hard. That showed me how real your love is, and it changed me.
    </p>

    <p>
        My love for you now is stronger because it has been tested. It’s a love that has seen pain but chose healing. A love that almost slipped away but was held onto with strength and faith. It comes from the deepest part of my heart, with gratitude, growth, and understanding. You mean more to me than words could ever explain, and I will never take what we have for granted again.
    </p>

    <p>
        I will always love you. I will always stay with you. I promise I will never leave you. Through every season of life, I want to stand beside you, support you, laugh with you, grow with you, and build a beautiful future together.
    </p>

    <p>
        Happy Valentine’s Day, my love.<br>
        Forever yours. 💜
